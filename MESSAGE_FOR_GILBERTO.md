## Questions Gilberto Might Ask

**Q: Can I just renew the domain myself?**
A: Yes, but you'd need to handle DNS, SSL certificates, and any technical issues. Keep-Lights-On plan ($200/year) does all this for you automatically.

**Q: What happens if I don't renew?**
A: Your website will go offline after the domain expires. You'll lose visibility in Google and customers won't be able to find you online.

**Q: Can I change plans later?**
A: Absolutely! You can upgrade or downgrade anytime. If you upgrade mid-term, I'll prorate the difference.

**Q: What if I need an emergency update outside my plan?**
A:
- Keep-Lights-On: Billed hourly at $75/hr
- Basic Care: Small updates included, major changes hourly
- Full Care: All updates included, no extra charges

**Q: These prices seem different from before. What changed?**
A: I corrected the pricing to industry-aligned rates. The old pricing was honestly too high for static site maintenance. This new pricing is fair, competitive, and sustainable for both of us.
