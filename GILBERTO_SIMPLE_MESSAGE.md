P.S. - The website and Google Business work you paid for ($500 + $120) is complete and yours forever. This is just the yearly renewal to keep it live on the internet. Think of it like paying your phone bill - you paid for the phone, but you still need service to use it.

## 📞 PHONE CALL SCRIPT (If He Calls)

### Opening:
"Hey Gilberto! Thanks for calling. I know this can be confusing - let me break it down super simple."

### Address the "I already paid" concern:

**You:** "So you remember you paid $500 for me to build your website, right? And $120 to set up your Google Business?"

**Him:** "Yes"

**You:** "Perfect. So that was like buying a house - you paid once, it's built, you own it. But just like a house has yearly property taxes, water bills, electric bills... a website has a domain renewal every year. That's what this is."

**You (continue):** "If you don't pay the domain renewal, your website literally disappears from the internet. It's like if you didn't pay your electric bill - the lights go out. The house is still there, but it's not usable."

### Explain the three options:

**Option 1 - Keep Lights On ($200/year or $20/month):**
"This is basically just paying the bill to keep it online. I'll renew the domain, handle the SSL certificate (the little padlock that makes it secure), and if something breaks, I'll fix it. But no updates, no changes - just keeping what you have online."

**Option 2 - Basic Care ($800/year or $75/month):**
"This is keeping it online PLUS I'll update your site 4 times per year. So like when spring comes and you want to add 'Spring Cleanup Special', or you finish a big job and want new photos - I'll update it for you every 3 months."

**Option 3 - Full Care ($1,800/year or $175/month):**
"This is keeping it online PLUS unlimited updates whenever you want. Finish a job today? Send me the photos, I'll add them tomorrow. Want to promote a special? Text me, I'll put it up. Plus I'm tracking your Google rankings, seeing what pages customers visit, and helping your site show up when people search for landscaping in DeKalb."

### Address payment flexibility:

**You:** "And here's the good part - you don't have to pay it all at once. You can split it up:"
- Monthly payments (smallest amount per payment)
- Every 2 weeks (matches payroll schedules)
- Weekly (if you prefer smallest chunks)
- Or annual (saves you money if you pay upfront)

### Close with urgency (but not pressure):

**You:** "Your domain expires in about 2 weeks. I'm not trying to pressure you, but if it expires and someone else grabs it, getting it back can be really expensive or impossible. So let's get this renewed this week so you don't have to worry about it."

**You:** "Which option sounds best for your business?"

## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (Be Ready)

### Q: "I thought I already paid for the website?"
**A:** "You did! You paid $500 to BUILD it, and that's done. This is the yearly renewal to KEEP it online - like paying your electric bill even though you already paid to build your house."

### Q: "Why didn't you tell me about this before?"
**A:** "Great question. When we built the site, I covered the first year's domain cost in the $500 you paid. Now we're coming up on year 2, so the renewal is due. After this, you'll know it's a yearly thing - just like renewing your business license."

### Q: "Can I just let it expire and do without a website?"
**A:** "You can, but here's what happens:
1. Customers searching for you online won't find your site
2. Your Google Business listing won't have a working website link (looks unprofessional)
3. You lose all the SEO work we did to get you ranked
4. Someone else could buy your domain name
5. If you want it back later, you might have to pay hundreds to get it back from whoever bought it"

### Q: "This seems expensive. Can I just do it myself?"
**A:** "Absolutely! The domain itself costs about $15-20/year. You'd need to:
1. Set up an account with a domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. Transfer the domain from my account to yours
3. Figure out where your website files are hosted
4. Set up DNS records (technical stuff)
5. Renew the SSL certificate annually
6. Handle any technical issues that come up

The $200/year option I'm offering basically saves you the headache of doing all that technical stuff. But if you're comfortable with it, I can help you transfer everything to your control."

### Q: "What if I want to try Option 1 and upgrade later?"
**A:** "Perfect! You can absolutely do that. Start with the $200/year 'Keep Lights On' option. If later you decide you want quarterly updates or unlimited changes, just let me know and I'll upgrade you. I'll even prorate it so you're not paying twice."

### Q: "Can I pay monthly instead of all at once?"
**A:** "Yes! Every option has 4 payment schedules:
- Pay yearly (cheapest overall)
- Pay monthly ($20, $75, or $175 depending on plan)
- Pay every 2 weeks (even smaller payments)
- Pay weekly (smallest possible payments, but you pay a bit more total)

Whatever fits your cash flow best."

### Q: "When does this need to be paid?"
**A:** "Your domain expires mid-November - about 2 weeks from now. I'd recommend choosing an option and getting it set up this week, so we're not scrambling at the last minute."

### Q: "What happens if I forget to pay?"
**A:** "If you choose monthly/bi-weekly/weekly payments, it's automatic through Stripe (same system as Netflix, Amazon, etc.). It just charges your card automatically. You won't forget because it's set-and-forget. If you choose annual, I'll remind you next year when it's time to renew again."
