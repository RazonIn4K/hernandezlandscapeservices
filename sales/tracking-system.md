## AUTOMATION OPPORTUNITIES

**After 10 manual conversions, consider automating:**

1. **WhatsApp Business API** → Schedule templates automatically
2. **Zapier/Make** → Auto-send Template #10 when Stripe webhook fires
3. **Calendly** → Let customers book 10-min calls instead of back-and-forth
4. **HubSpot Free CRM** → Better than manual spreadsheet
5. **Stripe Customer Portal** → Let customers manage subscriptions

**But for now:** Manual tracking is fine. You learn more this way.

---

## BACKUP & EXPORT

**Important:** Back up this data monthly.

1. **Export spreadsheet to CSV** (Google Sheets → Download → CSV)
2. **Save to:** `hernandezlandscapeservices/sales/data-backups/YYYY-MM.csv`
3. **Git commit:** "Add sales tracking data for [Month]"

**Never commit sensitive customer data to public repos!**

---

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-02
**Next Review:** After first conversion (update all metrics)
